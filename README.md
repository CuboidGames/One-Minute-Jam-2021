# Escape the Room 1'

This project is a submission for the [One Minute Jam 2021](https://itch.io/jam/one-minute-jam/rate/1286049) hosted on itch.io.

## Project archived

This is not a maintained project in any way. It is a one-time development for the sake of participating in the game jam. For this reason, and due to the limited time nature of the jam, be careful with using the code of this project or using it as a reference. It does not always necessarily follow good practices or principles for a clean code.
